Ascendo AI Community Jobs – Automated Job Discovery Agent 👷‍♂️🤖

A workflow built using n8n, JSearch API, and OpenAI to discover Field Service jobs, refresh data hourly, and generate community-focused insights.

📌 Overview

This project is my implementation of the Ascendo AI Community Jobs Agent, as requested in the assessment.
The goal of the agent is to:

Automatically discover Field Service jobs from online sources

Refresh the data every hour

Normalize and filter relevant senior roles

Generate LinkedIn/TikTok-ready insights and commentary

Support community growth for senior field service leaders

This version focuses on one stable and free source first — JSearch API (via RapidAPI) — and is designed so more sources (LinkedIn, RSS feeds, company URLs) can be plugged in later.

🧠 Architecture Summary
1. Job Collection Layer

Using n8n, the agent runs automatically every hour.
It calls the JSearch API to fetch jobs like:

Field Service Engineer

Field Service Technician

Field Service Manager

Field Service Director

The API returns jobs from multiple job boards & platforms (including LinkedIn-like aggregations).

All jobs are:

Normalized

Cleaned

De-duplicated

Limited to a safe count (e.g., 40) for LLM processing

This matches the requirement from the assessment on page 1:

“Find jobs in Field Service — this can be from... job posting sites with free API… refreshed every hour.”

2. AI Insight & Community Content Layer

The normalized jobs are then sent to OpenAI with a custom prompt written for:

Senior field service leaders

Community-focused insights

Trends analysis

LinkedIn/TikTok-style commentary


“This agent will be used to create engagement on LinkedIn, TikTok, and other platforms.”


3. Optional Frontend (Streamlit UI)

I created a simple Streamlit frontend where:

User clicks “Refresh Jobs”

Streamlit calls an n8n Webhook

n8n executes the workflow and returns the latest jobs + AI summary

User sees results instantly

This demonstrates how the agent could be used in the real world by community managers.

🛠️ Tech Stack

n8n – workflow automation & scheduling

JSearch API (RapidAPI) – job search API

OpenAI Chat Completions – commentary & analysis generation

Streamlit – frontend UI (optional)

Python (only for frontend)

JavaScript (n8n) for normalization logic

🔄 Workflow Steps (End-to-End)
1. Schedule Trigger (Every 1 Hour)

Starts the pipeline exactly as requested.

2. Build Jobs From Sources (Code Node)

Calls JSearch API

Normalizes job data

Infers seniority levels

Adds timestamps

Removes duplicates

3. Message a Model (OpenAI Node)

A curated shortlist of the best roles

A LinkedIn-style post

Optional TikTok hooks

High-level commentary on the job market

How I Will Broadcast This Agent:

To enhance the field service community, I will:

Share LinkedIn posts generated by the agent highlighting top senior roles weekly.

Publish short TikTok explainer clips about field service job trends, compensation, and technology shifts.

Invite senior field service leaders to review weekly summaries, creating a feedback loop.

Build a simple public dashboard using Streamlit Cloud so community members can check real-time job insights.

Partner with field service groups on LinkedIn to distribute insights and grow visibility.

This not only showcases the agent’s capabilities but also creates continuous engagement with both senior leaders and aspiring professionals.
